# Car Pool

*Car Pool* is a desktop (requires keyboard inputs) web game made with JavaScript. It uses *p5.js* for graphics and animation and uses *matter.js* to handle the 2d physics. The idea is based on *Rocket League*, a popular video game where cars play soccer against each other, but is based around the game of pool (aka billiards) instead.
